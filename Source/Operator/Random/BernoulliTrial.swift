    /* Random experiment with two possible outcomes: "success" or "failure".
     The "success" probability is configurable through the "p" value â€“ which is short for "probability".
     - Given `p=0.5`, this produces a randomization with 50% probability of getting "success" (e.g. coin toss).
     - Given `p=0.166`, the trial is akin to a dice toss, where 6 equals to "success".
