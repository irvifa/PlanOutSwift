             Calculate the weighted choice.
             The strategy is first to create an array with the weight values added into the next index (i.e. like Fibonacci sequence), and then use the first and last value as boundary to generate a random number.

             Example:

                Choices:    [A, B, C]
                weights:    [0.1, 0.3, 0.5]
                sumWeights: [0.1, (0.1+0.3), (0.1+0.3+0.5)]

             Second, generate a random number with min=0.1, max=0.9. Example: given random number 0.32, loop through sumWeights and stop at the index where random number > value. In this case, random number 0.32 will stop at index 1 because 0.32 â‰¤ 0.4.

             Example mapping:

                 0.0 - 0.1 => choice at index 0 (A)
                 0.11 - 0.4 => choice at index 1 (B)
                 0.41 - 0.9 => choice at index 2 (C)

             Finally, the index will then be used to make a choice (i.e. B).

            let sumWeights: [Double] = weightValues.reduce(into: []) { $0.append(($0.last ?? 0.0) + $1) }

            // ensure that there is a distance between min weight and max weight.
            guard let minWeight = sumWeights.first, let maxWeight = sumWeights.last, minWeight <= maxWeight else {
                throw OperationError.unexpected("Invalid weight values: \(sumWeights)")
            }

            // Generate the deterministically-random number.
            // The minValue is always 0, because we are generating a range. Regardless of the scale of weights used as argument, the randomization should always start from 0, because the first choice will be mapped if the random value falls between 0.0 - first sumWeights.
            let randomValue: Double = try getUniform(minValue: 0.0, maxValue: maxWeight)

            for (index, value) in sumWeights.enumerated() {
